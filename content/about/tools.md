**Kokkos Tools** is an innovative “plug in” software interface and a growing set of performance measurement and debugging tools that plug into that interface for application development teams to analyze the execution and memory performance of their software. Teams use this performance profiling and debugging information to determine how well they have designed and implemented their algorithms and to identify portions of their software that should be improved or behave erroneous. Kokkos Tools interfaces  leverage the Kokkos Core programming model interface to improve an application developer’s experience dramatically by using user provided labels to identify data structures and computations.
